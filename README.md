## Important: AI Prompting System

This repository serves as an AI prompting system that guides you in building a Next.js frontend application for QTI assessment editing. By following the prompting guidelines and providing clear requirements, you can interact with AI to help you develop the necessary components, features, and functionality.

The AI assistant is configured to understand:

- QTI 3.0 specification requirements
- Next.js frontend development patterns
- CSV-based data persistence strategies
- Component architecture and best practices

When interacting with the AI, you'll receive guidance, code snippets, and implementation details for building out your QTI editor application.

## Getting Started

First, open a terminal and run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
